== Use Cases

This workshop focuses on 2 main customer pain points:

* Compliance (OpenSCAP Scanning) and Vulnerability Management
* Patch/Package Management

== Presentations

The exercises are self explanatory and guide the participants through the entire lab.
All concepts are explained when they are introduced.

There is an optional presentation available to support the workshops and explain Automation, the basics of Ansible and the topics of the exercises in more detail.
Workshop presentation is located at https://aap2.demoredhat.com/decks/ansible_auto_satellite.pdf[Automated Satellite Workshop].

Also have a look at our Ansible Best Practices Deck: https://aap2.demoredhat.com/decks/ansible_best_practices.pdf[Ansible Best Practices]

== Time planning

The time required to do the workshops strongly depends on multiple factors: the number of participants, how familiar those are with Linux in general and how much discussions are done in between.

Each lab takes roughly 30-45 minutes.
